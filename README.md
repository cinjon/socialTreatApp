SocialTreat is an iOS app and website for connecting drug dependency centers and social workers responsible for their clients. 
It pushes forward what has been a nascent industry technologically. There is still work to do, including:

- Complete HIPAA Compliance
- Input treatment center matching algorithms
- Allow for centers to insert their availability on the website
- Get users on board.
